Steerers: A framework for rotation equivariant keypoint descripors
---

See the example notebook `demo.ipynb` for a simple matching example.
Before running it, create a new virtual environment of your preference (e.g. conda) with `python>=3.9`, `jupyter notebook` and GPU-enabled PyTorch.
Then install the `rotation_steerer` package using pip (this automatically installs DeDoDe from GitHub as well, see `setup.py`): 
```
pip install .
```
We will publish training code and further model weights shortly.
